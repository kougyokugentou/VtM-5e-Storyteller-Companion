# VtM-5e-Storyteller-Companion
Hey. So there's not a good PC companion app for VtM 5e storytellers to keep track of characters on the fly in an easy/convenient manner. Well I decided to do something about it in my infinite wisdom. This simple app will allow players to create and store as many characters of your choosing. also i included a simple dice roller function to quickly do checks against any stored character.

for this project i decided to exercise entity framework core and .net 7 core. both of them are new to me so be gentle.

taking all pull requests.
